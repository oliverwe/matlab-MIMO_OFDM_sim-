function z=receiver_impairments(r,g,phi,dc_i,dc_q)
%Function to add receiver impairments to the IQ branches
%[z]=iq_imbalance(r,g,phi) introduces DC and IQ imbalances between inphase
% and quadrature components of the complex baseband signal r. The model
% parameter g represents gain mismatch between the IQ branches of the receiver
% and parameter 'phi' represents phase error of local oscillator (in degrees).
% DC biases associated with each I,Q path are represented by dc_i and dc_q.
k = iq_imbalance(r,g,phi); %Add IQ imbalance
z = dc_impairment(k,dc_i,dc_q); %Add DC impairment
